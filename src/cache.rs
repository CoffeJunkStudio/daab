//!
//! Artifact caching structures
//!
//! This module contains the [`Cache`] and its pendant for Builders the
//! [`Resolver`]. The cache is the entrance point to retrieve the Artifacts from
//! Builders. It ensures the correct building of Artifacts if not known yet
//! and keeping them to allow looking them up repeatedly, without rebuilding
//! them.
//!
//! Notice: both types here are generic over their Artifact-Can (`ArtCan`) and
//! Builder-Can (`BCan`), for details about this advanced concept refer to
//! [crate description], for details about Cans see the [`canning`] module,
//! for simplified aliases (those with preset `ArtCan` & `BCan`) see any of the
//! alias modules: [`rc`], [`arc`], [`boxed`].

/// Structure for building, caching and dependency tracking of artifacts.
///
/// The `Cache` is the central structure of this crate. It helps to
/// avoid dependency duplication when multiple Builders depend on the same
/// Artifact.
///
/// Since all `Builder`s in the context of this crate are supposed to be wrapped
/// within `Blueprint`, the `Cache` is the only way of acquiring
/// an artifact in the first place.
///
/// Notice In the debugging version (when the **`diagnostics`** feature is active),
/// this struct contains a debugger `Doctor`, which
/// allows run-time inspection of various events.
/// In order to store it, the **`diagnostics`** `Cache` is generic to
/// some `Doctor`.
/// The `new` method then returns a `Cache<NoopDoctor>`
/// and `new_with_doctor` returns some `Cache<T>`.
///
/// Only an `Cache<T>` with `T: Sized` can be store in variables.
/// However, since most of the code does not care about the concrete
/// Doctor the default generic is `dyn Doctor`, on which all other methods are
/// defined.
/// An `Cache<dyn Doctor>` can not be stored, but it can be passed
/// on by reference (e.g. as `&mut Cache`). This prevents the use of
/// additional generics in **`diagnostics`** mode, and allows to easier achieve
/// compatibility between **`diagnostics`** and non-**`diagnostics`** mode.
/// To ease conversion between `Cache<T>` and
/// `Cache<dyn Doctor>` (aka `Cache`), all creatable
/// `Cache<T>`s (with `T: Sized`) implement `DerefMut`
/// to `Cache<dyn Doctor>`.
///
///
///
/// ## Artifact Accessors
///
/// The `Cache` provides the following set of accessors:
///
/// Basically there are the `get*` and the `lookup*` methods. The former will
/// create the artifact if it does not exist, but may return a build-error.
/// The latter directly returns `Some` Artifact or `None` if it is not in cache.
///
/// Each `get*` and `lookup*`, come in 4 different variants depending offering
/// different access semantics to the artifact.
/// - `Bin<T>` variant (`get` & `lookup`) returns a clone of the respective Bin
///    of the Artifact that is e.g. an `Rc<T>` when using `Rc<dyn Any>` as Can.
/// - `&T` variant (`get_ref` & `lookup_ref`) returns a reference to artifact
///   within this `Cache`.
/// - `&mut T` variant (`get_mut` & `lookup_mut`) returns a mutable reference
///   to artifact within this `Cache`.
/// - `T` variant (`lookup_cloned` & `get_cloned`) returns a clone of the
///   Artifact itself.
///
/// |           |`Bin<T>`| `&T`       | `&mut T`   | `T`           |
/// |-----------|--------|------------|------------|---------------|
/// |`Option`   |`lookup`|`lookup_ref`|`lookup_mut`|`lookup_cloned`|
/// |`Result`   |`get`   |`get_ref`   |`get_mut`   |`get_cloned`   |
/// |usable with|`rc`,`arc`|`rc`,`arc`,`boxed`|`boxed`|`rc`,`arc`,`boxed`|
///
/// _`Bin<T>` means `<ArtCan as Can<T>>::Bin` \
/// e.g. `Rc<T>` for types in `rc` module_
///
///
///
/// ## Caching Duration
///
/// Since this struct is a cache, it might keep the artifacts indefinitely,
/// which could cause memory-leak-like issues. In the following the precise
/// duration for storing Artifacts, dynamic states and Builders are described.
///
/// The `dyn_state` and `dyn_state_mut` will create a dynamic state for the
/// respective Builder if it does not exist yet in the `Cache`, thus
/// allocating memory.
///
/// Similarly, `get`, `get_ref`, `get_mut`, and `get_cloned` will produce the
/// Artifact with all dependent Artifacts, it will also allocate the dynamic
/// state for all Builders of those Artifacts, if it does not exist yet.
///
/// On the other hand, `get_dyn_state`, `lookup`, `lookup_ref`, `lookup_mut`,
/// and `lookup_cloned` methods will never add anything to the `Cache`.
///
/// With [`invalidate`], a specific Artifact can be removed from the `Cache`,
/// which will invalidate (means remove) all Artifacts that depended on it.
/// But this will never remove any dynamic state.
///
/// Whenever there is dynamic state or Artifact of an Builder in the cache,
/// the respective Builder will be kept too in a "weak" Can, that is
/// `std::rc::Weak<dyn Any>` when using the `rc` module. This will however keep
/// the entire memory of the respective Builder allocated, even when all
/// "strong" Cans are out of scope.
///
/// In order to remove also the dynamic state and thus the Builder Can form the
/// Cache there exists the [`purge`] method. However, it will only purge the
/// given builder, and invalidate the depending Artifact.
///
/// If there are (multiple) Builders go out of scope, they will not be removed
/// form this `Cache`. In order to remove _unreachable_ Builders including their
/// Artifacts and dynamic state, there is the [`garbage_collection`] method,
/// which will go through all the cached "weak" Builders and purge all that
/// became unreachable.
///
/// For diagnostics there are the [`is_builder_known`] and
/// [`number_of_known_builders`] methods.
///
/// To clear all Artifacts there is the [`clear_artifacts`] method. And to
/// purge all Builders from the `Cache` there is the [`clear_all`] method.

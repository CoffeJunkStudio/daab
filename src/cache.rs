/// Structure for caching and looking up artifacts.
///
/// The `ArtifactCache` is the central structure of this crate. It helps to
/// avoid dependency duplication when multiple `Builder`s depend on the same
/// artifact.
///
/// Since all `Builder`s in the context of this crate are supposed to be wrapped
/// within `ArtifactPromise`s, the `ArtifactCache` is the only way of acquiring
/// an artifact in the first place.
///
/// Notice In the debugging version (when the **`diagnostics`** feature is active),
/// this struct contains a debuger `Doctor`, which
/// allows run-time inspection of various events.
/// In order to store it, the **`diagnostics`** `ArtifactCache` is generic to
/// some `Doctor`.
/// The `new()` method then returns a `ArtifactCache<NoopDoctor>`
/// and `new_with_doctor()` returns some `ArtifactCache<Doc>`.
///
/// Only an `ArtifactCache<Doc>` with `Doc: Sized` can be store in variables.
/// However, since most of the code does not care about the concrete
/// `Doctor` the default generic is `dyn Doctor`, on which all other methods are
/// defined.
/// An `ArtifactCache<dyn Doctor>` can not be stored, but it can be passed
/// on by reference (e.g. as `&mut ArtifactCache`). This prevents the use of
/// additional generics in **`diagnostics`** mode, and allows to easier achive
/// compatibility between **`diagnostics`** and non-**`diagnostics`** mode.
/// To ease conversion between `ArtifactCache<Doc>` and
/// `ArtifactCache<dyn Doctor>` (aka `ArtifactCache`), all creatable
/// `ArtifactCache`s (i.e. not `ArtifactCache<dyn Doctor>`) implement `DerefMut`
/// to `ArtifactCache<dyn Doctor>`.
